                        <p> Here is the script from joel favieres "stay that way" video. He is a huge inspiration of mine and i feel everyone should read this. Also feel free to listen to some of his songs below. Enjoy :3 </p>
                        <p>“"I woke up, but I – but I wish I hadn’t. This is all in my head, right? Honestly, my arms and legs are completely separated from my will to my want - to my want to move forward. Move forward? Right. Move forward, right? This room - the room matches my mind, and I used to break this, all of it. The light is now - the light is now on, uhm. The room is completely lit up. But for some reason I still - I still can’t see absolutely anything. Not even through my lids. I - I just don’t even want to be. I don’t even want to be here. Wait, what? Why? Within a matter of seven hours of sleep, I’m numb, not loved - wait. Not loved? I’m loved, right? Right? It just - it just arrived - it’s, it’s stupid. I’m stupid. Am I? Yesterday I was high on happiness, yesterday I wanted to see today. Today I want nothing. No passions. What is passion? Am I insane? I have to be insane. Within five minutes of this next twenty-four hour day, I’ve already asked myself more questions than I’ve asked myself in the past year of my whole entire life. I feel ageless. I feel lost. Actually - not even lost - because if I was lost, that would mean I existed, which I don’t. Wait, do I? Yesterday I did. Or did I?This is what depression sounds like. This is what – - 20% of teens will suffer from a depressive order prier to adulthood. - 30% of teens that suffer from being seriously depressed have comorbidity meaning they also suffer from alcoholism or other substance abuse. - Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death in teenagers. - When it goes untreated it is the primary cause of suicide in teens where they are 12 times more likely to attempt suicide. - Only 30% of depressed teens get treatment. - 30! That’s a miniscule! - For every one suicide death in teens there are 10 more attempts. - Girls suffer from depression more often than boys, yet boys are more likely to die by suicide. - Teenage boys are less likely to seek help for their depressed feelings. - Almost 10% of the teen population has attempted suicide. - 20% have thought about it. - 15% of teens that suffer with a depressive disorder will develop bipolar disorder. - Approximately 1/3rd of depressed teens will have turned to alcohol or other substances. - Approximately 50% of depressed teens have a family history of depression. I was depressed.You feel like you can’t do anything about it. It’s a war - No mind.You’re surrounded by every single thought you thought you’d never have.Tell someone, something, it doesn’t even matter if it’s just a small sign. A bunch of small signs add up.If you’re reading this right now, that means you’re alive. Stay that way." -Joel Faviere.”^-^</p>
